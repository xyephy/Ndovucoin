How to Upgrade
==============
 
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the datadir needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended
to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
as frequently tested on them.


Wallet GUI
----------

For advanced users who have both (1) enabled coin control features, and
(2) are using multiple wallets loaded at the same time: The coin control
input selection dialog can erroneously retain wrong-wallet state when
switching wallets using the dropdown menu. For now, it is recommended
not to use coin control features with multiple wallets loaded.
=======
From Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no
longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance
when macOS "dark mode" is activated.

In addition to previously supported CPU platforms, this release's pre-compiled
distribution provides binaries for the RISC-V platform.

Notable changes
===============



=======
From Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.10 are no
longer supported, as Bitcoin Core is now built using Qt 5.9.x which requires
macOS 10.10+. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when
macOS "dark mode" is activated.

In addition to previously supported CPU platforms, this release's pre-compiled
distribution provides binaries for the RISC-V platform.

Notable changes
===============
=======
Build System
------------

- OpenSSL is no longer used by Bitcoin Core. The last usage of the library
was removed in #17265.

- glibc 2.17 or greater is now required to run the release binaries. This
retains compatibility with RHEL 7, CentOS 7, Debian 8 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Further details can be found in #17538.

New RPCs
--------

New settings
------------

- RPC Whitelist system. It can give certain RPC users permissions to only some RPC calls.
It can be set with two command line arguments (`rpcwhitelist` and `rpcwhitelistdefault`). (#12763)

Updated settings
----------------

Updated RPCs
------------

Note: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the
Low-level Changes section below.

GUI changes
-----------

- The "Start Bitcoin Core on system login" option has been removed on macOS.

Wallet
------

- The wallet now by default uses bech32 addresses when using RPC, and creates native segwit change outputs.
- The way that output trust was computed has been fixed in #16766, which impacts confirmed/unconfirmed balance status and coin selection.

Low-level changes
=================

Command line
------------

Command line options prefixed with main/test/regtest network names like
`-main.port=8333` `-test.server=1` previously were allowed but ignored. Now
they trigger "Invalid parameter" errors on startup.

Tests
-----

- It is now an error to use an unqualified `walletdir=path` setting in the config file if running on testnet or regtest
  networks. The setting now needs to be qualified as `chain.walletdir=path` or placed in the appropriate `[chain]`
  section. (#17447)

- `-fallbackfee` was 0 (disabled) by default for the main chain, but 0.0002 by default for the test chains. Now it is 0
  by default for all chains. Testnet and regtest users will have to add `fallbackfee=0.0002` to their configuration if
  they weren't setting it and they want it to keep working like before. (#16524)
